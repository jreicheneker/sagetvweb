    shadeblue's remote control.

1.4 October 18, 2008
  - Change package names from net.sf.sageplugins.* to sagex.*
  - Provide access to Jetty configuration objects.  Provides APIs for web applications to find
    server, port, etc. 
  - HTTP compression headers were set even when compression filter streams were not used.  This
    happened when an invalid URL was requested and an HTTP 404 response was sent by Jetty.  On the
    client, the browser displayed a message about invalid compression rather than an HTTP 404 error.
  - Ensure HTTP compression headers are set.  Somehow they are not always preserved after the filter
    chain finishes, and the client will display garbage in the window.
