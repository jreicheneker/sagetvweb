Merging SageTV's patched ffmpeg with AirVideo's patched ffmpeg (with segmenter)
===============================================================================

SageTV 7.0.13's ffmpeg is based on svn revision 24249.  There are two files from
Sage.  ffmpeg-sage-7.0.13.zip is their full ffmpeg patched source.  libavformat-sage-
7.0.13.zip is a patch for usleep.  Apply the second file to the first and save in the
ffmpeg-sage-7.0.13 directory.  (These merges should already be applied but are mentioned
here to document the steps).

AirVideo's ffmpeg as of 7/31/10 was mainly based on svn revision 21569.  It includes
ffmpeg, an HTTP Live Streaming segmenter, and configure scripts for Windows and Mac.
The latest revision can be downloaded from http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/licenses.html.
Direct link: http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/download/ffmpeg-for-2.2.5.tar.bz2.

ffmpeg-segmenter.diff was created using the Kompare tool by comparing the ffmpeg-r21659
and ffmpeg-for-2.2.5 directories.  This is a list of all the changes made by InMethod AirVideo.
This set of changes is then applied to the ffmpeg-sage-7.0.13-and-segmenter-2.2.5
directory.

I patched the following files from InMethod AirVideo.  Also merge any
new files (mainly those that begin with an underscore '_').  Don't worry about libswscale changes.

    libavcodec/resample.c
    libavformat/mpegtsenc.c
    libavformat/os_support.c/h
    ffmpeg.c
    (and maybe configure)

ffmpeg source can be retrieved using the following commands in Linux:

    svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-r21587 -r 21587
    svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-r21622 -r 21622
    svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-r21659 -r 21659
    svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-r24249 -r 24249

Build scripts for each platform are (TODO, this is not accurate or complete):

    make-linux32
    make-macos
    make-mingw32/mbuild.sh (windows)

On Windows, cygwin must be set up before building anything else.  A copy of cygwin
used to build the binaries is in the cygwin.zip file.

Several dependencies need to be downloaded and built before building ffmpeg (copies
of these files are in the 'packages' directory):

    AirVideo Server
    http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/licenses.html

    libx264
    ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/x264/snapshots/

    faad2, faac
    http://www.audiocoding.com/downloads.html

    lame
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/files/lame/

    yasm
    http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/wiki/Download

    xvidcore
    ?/xvidcore-1.2.2.tar.gz would not build, use xvidcore-bin.zip instead



A few notes to myself:
building ffmpeg
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Auk-5AZuERkJ:www.cihilt.com/book/export/html/49+ffmpeg+%22-L/usr/local/lib%22&cd=28&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
If Libraries couldnt be found and it gave error message on make, try to run the ffmpeg configure lines with path to libs
./configure --enable-shared --enable-libmp3lame --enable-xvid --enable-libvorbis --enable-libogg --enable-gpl --enable-libfaad --enable-libfaac --enable-x264 --enable-amr_nb --enable-amr_nb-fixed --enable-pp --extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/include --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/lib
make
make install
